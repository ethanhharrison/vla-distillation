# VLA Distillation

Tooling for building a language-instruction dataset from [DROID](https://droid-dataset.github.io/)
robot trajectories. Given a trajectory (stored as a TFRecord), the pipeline
samples frames along the trajectory and prompts a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
propose natural-language instructions the robot could accomplish starting at each
sampled step.

## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Create the environment and
install dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install \
  google-cloud-storage tqdm tensorflow \
  openai google-genai python-dotenv
```

Run any command in the environment with `uv run ...` (examples below).

### API keys

The VLM backends read credentials from environment variables. You can export
them directly or place them in a `.env` file at the project root (auto-loaded via
`python-dotenv`):

```bash
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key      # or GOOGLE_API_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

> Get a Gemini key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
> If you hit `API_KEY_SERVICE_BLOCKED`, make sure the **Generative Language API**
> is enabled for the key's project and the key has no conflicting API
> restrictions.

## 1. Download TFRecords

DROID TFRecords live in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Downloading requires GCP
credentials — authenticate once with Application Default Credentials:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Then download some records:

```bash
uv run python scripts/download_dataset.py
```

By default this downloads **3 randomly selected** success records from
`gs://pranav-us-east5/datasets/droid/success/` into `datasets/droid/success/`.

To change how many (or which) records are pulled, call `download_droid_records`
directly:

```bash
# Download 10 records (no shuffle = deterministic first 10)
uv run python -c "from scripts.download_dataset import download_droid_records; download_droid_records(10, shuffle=False)"
```

Arguments to `download_droid_records`:

| Argument       | Default                      | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `num_records`  | (required)                   | Number of TFRecords to download.         |
| `bucket_name`  | `pranav-us-east5`            | GCS bucket to pull from.                 |
| `droid_folder` | `datasets/droid/success/`    | Folder prefix within the bucket.         |
| `shuffle`      | `True`                       | Randomly sample records before slicing.  |

### (Optional) Inspect a record

To see the structure of a TFRecord (feature names, types, sample values) and
dump the first frame of each camera to `images/`:

```bash
uv run python scripts/view_dataset.py
```

## 2. Generate language instructions

Walk a trajectory at a configurable step interval and prompt a VLM at each
sampled step:

```bash
uv run python -m pipeline.language_instruction.generate \
  datasets/droid/success/success-00188.tfrecord \
  --provider gemini \
  --step-interval 25 \
  --num-instructions 3 \
  --save-images
```

This writes a text file to `outputs/language_instructions/` and (with
`--save-images`) the queried frames to `outputs/language_instruction_images/<record>/`.

### CLI options

| Flag                  | Default             | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `record`              | (required)          | Path to a `.tfrecord` file.                                        |
| `--provider`          | `gemini`            | VLM backend: `gemini`, `openai`, or `dummy`.                       |
| `--model`             | provider default    | Model name (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`).                    |
| `--step-interval`     | `25`                | Sample and prompt every N steps of the trajectory.                |
| `--num-instructions`  | `3`                 | Number of candidate instructions to request per step.             |
| `--cameras`           | all three cameras   | Which camera image features to send to the VLM.                   |
| `--max-steps`         | `None`              | Only consider steps up to this index (useful for quick runs).     |
| `--example-index`     | `0`                 | Which example within the TFRecord to use.                          |
| `--output`            | auto-named          | Output `.txt` path.                                                |
| `--save-images`       | off                 | Save the camera frame(s) at each queried step.                    |
| `--image-dir`         | auto (per record)   | Where to save queried-step frames.                                 |

The two most important knobs:

- **`--provider` / `--model`** — swap which VLM is used.
- **`--step-interval`** — how far apart (in trajectory steps) the sampled frames
  are. Nearby frames look nearly identical, so a larger interval yields more
  distinct scenes.

### Output format

Each run produces a text file summarizing the run configuration followed by the
per-step instructions (and, if `--save-images` is set, the saved frame paths):

```
record: datasets/droid/success/success-00188.tfrecord
provider: gemini
model: gemini-2.0-flash
step_interval: 25
...
============================================================

  - open the top drawer

  ...
```

## Choosing / adding a VLM backend

Backends live in `pipeline/language_instruction/vlm.py`. Each implements a single
method, `generate(prompt, images) -> str`, and registers itself under a provider
name. Built-in backends:

- `openai` — GPT models via the `openai` SDK
- `gemini` — Gemini models via `google-genai`
- `dummy` — offline stub that returns canned instructions

Add a new provider by subclassing `VLM` and decorating it:

```python
from pipeline.language_instruction.vlm import VLM, register_vlm

@register_vlm("myprovider")
class MyVLM(VLM):
    def __init__(self, model, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(model)
        # set up your client here

    def generate(self, prompt: str, images: list[bytes]) -> str:
        ...  # return the model's raw text response
```

It is then selectable via `--provider myprovider`.

## Programmatic use

```python
from pathlib import Path
from pipeline.language_instruction import GenerationConfig, generate_instructions

config = GenerationConfig(
    record_path=Path("datasets/droid/success/success-00188.tfrecord"),
    provider="gemini",
    step_interval=25,
    num_instructions=3,
    save_images=True,
)
result = generate_instructions(config)
for step in result.steps:
    print(step.step, step.instructions, step.image_paths)
```

`generate_instructions` returns structured `StepInstructions(step, instructions,
raw_response, image_paths)` objects rather than only writing text, which makes it
straightforward to feed the results into downstream tooling.

## Roadmap

- **Instruction verification**: prompt a VLM with each generated instruction and
  its corresponding step frames to judge whether the instruction is achievable
  and well-grounded. The structured `(step, instructions, image_paths)` output is
  designed to be consumed directly by this future verification pass.
